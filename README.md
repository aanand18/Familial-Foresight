# Familial-Foresight
Our project is a Machine Learning model which aims to prevent the kids (below the age of 8-9) from viewing things which are unsuitable for them as news articles which gorily describe the murder scenes. News and articles on rape and describing the act which creates a sense of unsafety in the minds of kids. Articles or pieces which talk about suicide as a way to escape problems as that would imbue a sense of having an escape route in the form of suicide. Self-derogatory or self-demotivating articles which tend to undermine the confidence of kids and make them feel unsafe about their insecurities.

This model can also be used for potentially preventing certain videos from being uploaded to video streaming platforms like YouTube. This can be done by generating the subtitles for the video and then running our model on that text and based on what the model has been trained on as being suitable and unsuitable, it can prevent the upload of the video and save man-power because of the immense amounts of video uploaded every day which is impossible to be scrutinized by humans individually.
